							<p>Rolling Blackouts Coastal Fever is a band formed in 2013 in Melbourne, Australia that is described as something between "tough pop" and "soft punk". Sideways to New Italy was the first time I had heard the band yet somehow it was put on my Spotify front page when it was released. The first thing I noticed was how upbeat the album was, carried through the super-intense and super-catchy guitars. I later learned that was because they play with three guitars and no bass, which allows them to layer different effects and riffs together.</p>
							<p>The album itself rolls together nicely, without any sort of standout track. I enjoy all of the tracks on the record, but my favourite is probably <i>Cameo</i> with its burst of energy as it hits the first chorus that continues throughout the rest of the song - <code>You take a high wire jump \ You feel time dripping away</code>. The acoustic guitars on the next song, <i>Sunglasses at the Wedding</i>, sound colourful and peaceful. The lyrics <code>Why are we always the last ones to leave?</code> really complete the song (listen to it, you'll see why).</p>
							<p>I don't really have much else to say about this record, I like it. It makes me happy.</p>
